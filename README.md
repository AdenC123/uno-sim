#  ***CardProto*** - UBC CPSC 210 term project

## *What is this?*
This project will be a Java application to allow game designers (and their friends)
to quickly prototype and play basic card games before commiting their ideas to paper. 
It will support addition and modification of cards with various fields, 
a system to simulate multiplayer games with those cards, 
and a way to generate images of cards for easy printing.

## *Why?*
The hardest part of designing a game is tuning all the finicky numbers that make the game fun and balanced.
I hope to make a tool that makes that process a bit easier! I also want to gain experience
designing programs that run games.

## *User stories:*
- As a user, I want to create and modify cards with a name, a cost, and text.
- As a user, I want to add and remove my cards from a deck.
- As a user, I want to simulate games with my deck by drawing and playing cards from my hand.
- As a user, I want to generate pictures of my cards.
