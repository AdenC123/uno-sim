#  ***CardSim*** - UBC CPSC 210 term project

## What is this?
This project will be a simulator for multiplayer card games. Users will be able to build a deck of cards using the
standard 54 card set, then start a pass-and-play game with other players. During a game, players will be able to
draw cards from a draw deck and play them from their hand.

## Why?
I love playing card games like Hearts and Red King, but sometimes I don't have a deck to use or a place to put cards!
Hopefully, this project can be used as a substitute for a playing space when on a car, plane, or bus.
I also want to gain experience designing programs that run games.

## User stories
- As a user, I want to add and remove cards from the playing deck.
- As a user, I want to start a game with an arbitrary number of players and a shuffled deck.
- As a user, I want to draw cards from a draw pile and add them to my hand.
- As a user, I want to view the cards in my hand and play them into my play space or into a discard pile.

## Stretch goals
- Add custom cards beyond the 54 card set to a deck
