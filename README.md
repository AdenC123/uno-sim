#  ***UnoSim*** - UBC CPSC 210 term project

## What is this?
This project will be a simulator for the card game Uno.
Users will be able to start a pass-and-play game with any number of players and any number of starting cards,
then play using an infinite randomized deck.

## Why?
I love playing Uno, but sometimes I don't have a deck to use or a place to put cards!
Plenty of Uno simulators already exist to solve this problem, but they are all web-based and don't work offline.
Hopefully, this project can be used as a substitute for a playing space when on a car, plane, or bus.
I also want to gain experience designing programs that run games.

## User stories
- As a user, I want to start a game with a given number of players.
- As a user, I want to add multiple starting cards to each player's hand.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the cards in my hand.
- As a user, I want to play a valid card onto the discard pile.
- As a user, I want to add a card to my hand if I don't have any valid cards to play.
- As a user, I want the game to end when a player runs out of cards.
- As a user, I want to have the option to save the current game at the beginning of my turn.
- As a user, I want to have the option to load an existing game instead of starting a new one.

## Stretch goals (beyond minimum product)
- Power cards: +2, +4, Wild, Skip, Reverse
- Sorted cards: automatically sort the cards in the player's hand as they draw them
- Support 10 to 1: start with ten cards each and play games down to one card each
- Choose infinite draw or single draw
- Optional +2 and +4 stacking rule
